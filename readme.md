# Module Use documentation

If you want to make tweaks and/or just run the code yourself for whatever reason, follow these steps. (Note: these are *nix-oriented, but should adapt easily enough to Windows.)

1. Install [KindleGen](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765211). It doesn't particularly matter where or how you install, as long as you know where it ends up.
2. If Ruby is not installed on your system, [install it](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/). (Note that OS X comes bundled with it after 10.5.)
3. Install the (deprecated but required for this plugin) hpricot module: `gem install hpricot`.
4. Update the KindleGen build by setting the parameter strings in the `properties.rb` file:
    a. Update path to the `kindlegen` utility in $KINDLE_GEN wherever you chose to install it -- for me, this was `/Applications/KindleGen/kindlegen` on my Mac. twcamper installed his instance at `~/mobigen/kindlegen`. Put yours wherever tickles your fancy.
    b. Update the value of `$OUTPUT` in `properties.rb`; otherwise, it will automatically generate the `.mobi` file in the root directory of the project.
5. In `lib`, run `ruby build_book.rb build ../content/sicp.opf ../content/toc.ncx`

That should do the trick. You'll have a new version of `sicp.mobi` in your base directory, which you can then push to your Kindle

# Original writeup
_Original work all done by twcamper_

## Slight reformatting of the online SICP
Original pages at http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html

1. I got the source: `wget -r http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html`
2. used hpricot to:
    - remove 'navigation' divs
    - insert `<mbp:pagebreak />` tags at the top of each html body ( this keeps lines from getting split )
3. removed cover page 'book.html' since there's already a cover image
4. set `height="2em"` on div tags in 'References' section (kindle doesn't support the CSS for controlling this)
5. added jump table to top of index
6. built opf and ncx with ruby. toc.ncx allows 'nav points' for the 5-way kindle knob to get you from chapter to chapter
