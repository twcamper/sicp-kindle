Slight reformatting of the pages at http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html

1 - I got the source:
      wget -r http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html

2 - used hpricot to:
      - remove 'navigation' divs
      - insert <mbp:pagebreak /> tags at the top of each html body ( this keeps lines from getting split )

3 - removed cover page 'book.html' since there's already a cover image

4 - set text-indent: 0 for <p> tags, since kindle indents about 1em by default, which deformatted the code snips (<p><tt> is used instead of <pre>)

5 - set height="2em" on div tags in 'References' section (kindle doesn't support the CSS for controlling this)

6 - added jump table to top of index

7 - built opf and ncx with ruby.  toc.ncx allows 'nav points' for the 5-way kindle knob to get you from chapter to chapter


TODO: fix image at Figure 1.1, the tree diagram.  (comes out darkened for some reason)
TODO: read the damn book!
